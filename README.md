# Font Collection
## A small repository hosting multiple fonts intended to be used on Linux systems, after installation.



### This repository exists to host a collection of fonts that can be used on Linux systems post-installation, such as Arch Linux and Gentoo, which are barebones after a clean installation, it also exists to provide compatibility with Microsoft Windows systems to read documents and write, and to help with missing characters system-wide. I've included Asian fonts so you no longer see squares on your linux system.

# Disclaimer:
* You may contribute by adding fonts to Main or Extra directories.
* When packaging, redistribute the same licence. this repository is mainly intended for private use.
* Commercial use of the fonts is allowed, but giving credits to all the designers who worked hard into making such amazing fonts.
* Everything comes "AS IS", so neither the font creators, or me, take responsability for any damage to your system if you do something wrong.



# Usage:
* To use the fonts on this repo, git clone it, or download as zip (until it gets properly packaged for distros), then use your DE font manager or install to system folders to get the fonts working. you may need to reboot or re-login to see changes.
