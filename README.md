# Core-Fonts
A small repository containing multiple fonts to be used on Linux systems, Post Installation.




This repository exists to host a collection of fonts that can be used on Linux systems post-installation, such as Arch Linux and Gentoo, which are barebones after a clean installation.



It also exists to provide compatibility with Microsoft Windows systems to read documents and write.


* You May repackage this for the AUR or other distros packaging methods, non-commercial use.
