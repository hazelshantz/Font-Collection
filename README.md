# Core-Fonts
A small repository containing multiple fonts to be used on Linux systems, Post Installation.

## I'm currently looking for contributors to package this for the AUR, so if you are willing to help, please reach me out.


This repository exists to host a collection of fonts that can be used on Linux systems post-installation, such as Arch Linux and Gentoo, which are barebones after a clean installation.



It also exists to provide compatibility with Microsoft Windows systems to read documents and write.

# Note:
* You may contribute by adding fonts to Main or Extra directories.


* To use the fonts on this repo, git clone it, or download as zip (until it gets properly packaged for distros), then use your DE font manager or install to system folders to get the fonts working. you may need to reboot or re-login to see changes.
